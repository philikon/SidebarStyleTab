* Changed the tree twisty triangles to the ones familiar from the
  native Mac OS X tree widget.

* The child-tab count now appears in bubbles familiar from other Mac OS X
  applications like Mail.app.

* Fixed a subtlety concerning the separator between the tab bar and
  the content window.

* Moved the "new tab" button (+) from the tab bar to the status bar on
  the bottom left, much like the bottom-left buttons in Mail.app and
  other Mac OS X applications.
