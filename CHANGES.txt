1.1 (XXX)
---------

* Changed the tree twisty triangles to the ones familiar from the
  native Mac OS X tree widget.

* The child-tab count now appears in bubbles familiar from other Mac OS X
  applications like Mail.app.

* Fixed a subtlety concerning the separator between the tab bar and
  the content window.

* Got rid of the new tab button (+) in the tab bar.  Instead we have
  one in the status bar on the bottom left, much like the bottom-left
  buttons in Mail.app and other Mac OS X applications.
