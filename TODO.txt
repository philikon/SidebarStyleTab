* statusbar splitters:

  - when the synchronized object can't change its width anymore
    (e.g. because it's at its minimum width), the splitter shouldn't
    be allowed to move.

* sync with TreeStyleTab:

  - When you want to drop a tab on another tab, a whole lot of stuff moves

  - Background for indented tabs should cover the whole width
