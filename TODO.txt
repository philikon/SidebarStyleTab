* statusbar splitters:

  - hide and disable the tabbar stuff when the tabbar isn't in
    vertical mode.

  - when the synchronized object can't change its width anymore
    (e.g. because it's at its minimum width), the splitter shouldn't
    be allowed to move.

* check out -moz-appearance: treewisty/treetwistyopen;

* improve drag'n'drop styling

* background for indented tabs should cover the whole width
