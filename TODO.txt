* statusbar splitters:

  - when the synchronized object can't change its width anymore
    (e.g. because it's at its minimum width), the splitter shouldn't
    be allowed to move.

* check out -moz-appearance: treewisty/treetwistyopen;

* improve drag'n'drop styling

  - When you want to drop something on a tab, a whole lot of stuff moves

* background for indented tabs should cover the whole width
