* Firefox 3.6

  - border-top is missing from selected tab

  - even on root tabs the background gradient doesn't extend all the
    way to the left border.

  - either favicon is too low or background doesn't extend down enough.

* improve drag'n'drop styling

* spacing to the left is a bit cramped (border -> twisty -> icon)

* background for indented tabs should cover the whole width
