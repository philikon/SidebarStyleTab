The TreeStyleTab add-on provides a vertical tab bar which allows you
to arrange tabs in trees.  This add-on restyles this tab bar to look
like the sidebar on Mac OS X, which in turn is modelled after sidebars
of other Mac OS X applications such as iTunes.

For this add-on to take effect, you need to

a) install the TreeStyleTab add-on
   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5890

b) configure TreeStyleTab to display the tab bar on the left or right
   hand side,

c) set the appearance of the tab bar to "Default (specified by the
   Theme)"

Note that the target platform of this add-on is Mac OS X, as it was
designed to immitate the look-and-feel of the sidebar on that system.
Other platforms may work but not have the effect you desire.
Restrictions may apply, your mileage may vary, etc. blabla.

This add-on is released under the Mozilla Public License Version 1.1.
